# Set up initial app

1. Install **Node.js LTS** (from nodejs.org) if you don’t have it.
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and run:

   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest democracy-tracker --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --use-npm
   cd democracy-tracker
   npx shadcn@latest init -d
   npx shadcn@latest add button card input textarea slider
   npm i framer-motion recharts html2canvas lucide-react
   ```
3. Open the project folder in your editor (or stay in Terminal) and replace the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with the code I put in the canvas. Add **'use client'** at the very top.
4. Start it:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Visit **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
6. Use **Export Card** to download the image for posting.

# Steps to enable Pages
+ Needed because this repo is being served as a link from my personal github.io page
1. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**:

   * Choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Under **Branch**:

   * Select **main**.
   * In the **Folder** dropdown, select **/docs**.
4. Click **Save**.


* After saving, you’ll see a green box appear that says something like:

  > *Your site is live at [https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/](https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/)*
* The first time, it can take **2–5 minutes** before the URL works.
* Refresh with **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or use incognito) to bypass cached 404s.

# Test the PR locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # open http://localhost:3000 and click around
npm run build:pages && npm run deploy:pages
```

(That copies the static export into `docs/` so you can sanity-check the export locally in the repo.)

## If it looks good, merge the PR to `main`

**Easiest: GitHub UI**

* Open the PR on GitHub and click **Merge pull request**.

**Or locally**

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git merge --no-ff origin/codex/improve-code-for-better-maintainability -m "Merge PR #1"
git push origin main
```

## Publish the updated site to GitHub Pages

Because Pages serves from `main`’s `docs/`, rebuild after the merge:

```bash
# ensure you’re on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull

# rebuild static export and publish to docs/
npm run build:pages
npm run deploy:pages

git add docs
git commit -m "Publish updated tracker to GitHub Pages"
git push
```

Your live URL stays: **[https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/](https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/)**
