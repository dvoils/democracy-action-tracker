# Set up initial app

1. Install **Node.js LTS** (from nodejs.org) if you donâ€™t have it.
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and run:

   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest democracy-tracker --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --use-npm
   cd democracy-tracker
   npx shadcn@latest init -d
   npx shadcn@latest add button card input textarea slider
   npm i framer-motion recharts html2canvas lucide-react
   ```
3. Open the project folder in your editor (or stay in Terminal) and replace the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with the code I put in the canvas. Add **'use client'** at the very top.
4. Start it:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Visit **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
6. Use **Export Card** to download the image for posting.

# Steps to enable Pages
+ Needed because this repo is being served as a link from my personal github.io page
1. In the repo, go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment â†’ Source**:

   * Choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Under **Branch**:

   * Select **main**.
   * In the **Folder** dropdown, select **/docs**.
4. Click **Save**.


* After saving, youâ€™ll see a green box appear that says something like:

  > *Your site is live at [https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/](https://dvoils.github.io/democracy-action-tracker/)*
* The first time, it can take **2â€“5 minutes** before the URL works.
* Refresh with **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or use incognito) to bypass cached 404s.

# Test the PR locally

Run this sequence in your repo root:

```bash
# Make sure you have the latest branches from GitHub
git fetch origin

# Create a new test branch based on main
git checkout -b modular-refactor origin/main

# Merge in the PR branch
git merge origin/codex/improve-code-for-better-maintainability

# Install dependencies (in case PR added new ones)
npm install

# Run locally in dev mode
npm run dev

# Build + deploy to docs/ (simulate GitHub Pages)
npm run build:pages && npm run deploy:pages
```

## What this does

* `git fetch origin` â†’ pulls down the latest PR branch from GitHub.
* `git checkout -b modular-refactor origin/main` â†’ creates a fresh branch from your main branch.
* `git merge origin/codex/improve-code-for-better-maintainability` â†’ merges in the PR changes so you can test them.
* Then you just install, run, and build as usual.


ðŸ‘‰ If everything looks good in your local test, you can merge the PR into `main` directly on GitHub, and then re-run:

```bash
git pull origin main
npm run build:pages && npm run deploy:pages
git add docs
git commit -m "Publish updated tracker"
git push
```

asdf 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # open http://localhost:3000 and click around
npm run build:pages && npm run deploy:pages
```

(That copies the static export into `docs/` so you can sanity-check the export locally in the repo.)

## If it looks good, merge the PR to `main`

**Easiest: GitHub UI**

* Open the PR on GitHub and click **Merge pull request**.

**Or locally**

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git merge --no-ff origin/codex/improve-code-for-better-maintainability -m "Merge PR #1"
git push origin main
```

## Publish the updated site to GitHub Pages

Because Pages serves from `main`â€™s `docs/`, rebuild after the merge:

```bash
# ensure youâ€™re on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull

# rebuild static export and publish to docs/
npm run build:pages
npm run deploy:pages

git add docs
git commit -m "Publish updated tracker to GitHub Pages"
git push
```
